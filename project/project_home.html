            <h2>Welcome to the World of the Cosmere</h2>
            <p>The Cosmere is a vast, interconnected universe that spans multiple planets, each with its own distinct magic systems, cultures, and characters. While each story takes place on a different world, they are linked by shared themes, ancient mysteries, and recurring elements that suggest a larger, underlying connection. As readers journey through the Cosmere, they uncover secrets about the nature of reality, the forces shaping the universe, and the relationships between the various worlds and their inhabitants.</p>
